Story
The game is gonna be a a 2D side scroller style gallery shooter.  With the premise that you are a one of the last survivors of a destroyed universe/timeline, you have escaping from the destruction of your universe/timeline together with people from your universe/timeline you have built a safe-haven on ‘A Singularity Point’, an inflection point between a black and a white hole, that is disconnected/unaffected from any and all timeline, giving anybody on it the privilege to be outside of the supervision of time and spcae. Effectively giving them the ability to see all of the future and past of these universes. But there exists one exception to this alseeing natures. The ones outside of the multiverse, ones who are are unaffected by time and space and their regulations, we call them Harbingers and their origin, The Void. It is unknown where they came from a higer dimension maybe or outside of the multiverse nobody knows exactly but one thing is certain they are harbingers of destruction and chaos. but these eldrich horros/beings only want the end of the multiverse. After learning of the atrocities comited by the harbingers of void, the survivors of your old timeline decided to establish a multiverse defense force, MDF. Traveling from universe to universe and protecting it from the Harbingers. While recruiting others to the cause and  increasing our strongholds on more Singularity Points across the multiverse and protecting it from the forces of void which destroyed our uiverse/timline and countlesss others.
Gameplay
Menu/start: You start at a start screen which also has a diagram or text that explains the basic controls. You can also see a  start button which, when clicked takes you to the beginning of the game.
 Level desing/Waves: 
you start with your spaceship on the left side attacking the enemies coming from the right side. 
wave after wave of enemies comes towards you which you then attack and destroy/defeat. after a certain score or time or a certain number of waves or a boss:  
you can choose bettween  2 different dimmentional doors to go through. you can choose to enter a new DD(dimmensional door) the game gives you two choices one the the top right one at the bottom right each takes you to another dinmension with different style,music and enemies.
Movement: you have four directional movements. with freedom confined in tothe walls of the screen
Hazards - possible not certain yet 
if there is enough time we can imple,ent a hazard sytem where each dimmension can have different hazards that attack the players from other angles that the enemies, as enemies can only attack formt he right side we can have other attacks that come from the top, the bottom, or even the left side.
Scoring/Currency, Wave design, Possible(boss fights), possible(hub), Health sytem, upgrade sytem.
Hub - possible not certain yet
We can maybe even have a main hub where spaceship hovers on a platform suspended in the void, surrounded by floating portals leading to different dimensions. Each portal emits a distinct glow which indicates whart are the dinmensions inside
a place where you can choose to open/unlok new portals depending on your dimmensional shards(money/score) (how far you have gone how many enemies you killed) or gain upgrades or new ships deoending on your dimmensional shards.  you can go through any of the opened portals you have. which are stationed aren the main hub platform where your upgrade/docking station is. 

Score
Each enemy will give you a point for score. 
players will be given the choice to change their dimmension between every 100/500 score(not yet decided). (or we can add a boos at those score marks adn then they ge tto go to a different dimension)
Every dimension you go through will(either give you a dimensional shard/skillpoint/currency that you cna use to upgrade your ships health,speed attack, etc. or increase your maximum point at the end of the run)
Upgrades - possible not certain yet 
upgrades system could be implemented, tha tupgrades healt damage, speed etc.
Health sytem - basic
if the upgrade system is implemented your ship will start with just 1 life and then get stronger.
 if the upgrade system is not implemented your ship will have 3 life.
the life will be healed at every 2 dinmensions 200/1000 score( double the dimension change value)
Health sytem - more complex 
might be done if time is enough or if we want tto have harder enemies like bullet hell style
the upgrade system will need to be implemented, your ship will just 1 life, however it will also have a upgradeble/recargable dinmenional shield that surround your ships, that will block most of the shots while spending some energy/shield charge  but will not block certain shots like(armor piercing, certain hazards or boss ultimates)  
the shield will be recharged after every new dimension/dinmensional door. 
if you dies in the fight the screeen goes black(and/or shows you your score and dimensional shards) then teleports you back to the main hub or the menu screen).
